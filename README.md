# HR-Data-Analysis-project
Analyzed HR attendance data for ~100 employees over 3 months (Aprâ€“Jun) using Power BI. Performed data cleaning &amp; transformation (unpivoting, calculated columns, reshaping data), and built dashboards to track presence rates, work patterns (onsite, hybrid, WFH), and leave trends.
